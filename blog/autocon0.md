AI conversation with John Willis 
- Weavicte 
- The AI LLM are based on Vector type Databases 
- Creating the vector is 3d model of data similar to autocorrect algorithms where the % of the previous or next letter 
- or word are used 
- You can use Markdown to "chunk" out the data for the vector 
- Be mindful of how the chunking and data model is fed 
- MongoDB was the recommended DB Vector to store information
